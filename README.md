# cuda-std-par

This reprository hosts the code used as an assignment as part of a 2 weeks GPU programming workshop organised by [IIT Madras](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~rupesh/events/gpu2022/).

The assignment is available as a jupyter notebook and can be run on a GPU enabled Google colaboratory environment.

**Tip**: Solve the assignment before looking into the solutions to understand not only `std::par` but also general CUDA code optimisation better.
